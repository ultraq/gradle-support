Gradle Support
==============

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions)

Gradle plugins that help support my workflow.  The plugins are very geared
towards how I work, so might not be of much use to anybody else.  Since many of
my public projects rely on them however, I thought it best to distribute these
plugins so others can build my projects on their own machines.

Before this was a binary plugin repository, it was a collection of plain Gradle
build scripts that I referenced with raw GitHub URLs to tagged versions.  Gradle
has been discouraging that approach for a *very* long time, so now I'm trying to
go legit ðŸ˜…  If you're looking for one of those older scripts, use the
branch/tag navigation control to select tags not ending with a `-binary` in the
name to locate them.


Installation
------------

These plugins are built targeting Gradle 9, so require Java 17 as well.

```groovy
// settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

// build.gradle
plugins {
  id 'nz.net.ultraq.gradle.fluent-configuration' version '0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```


API
---

With the fluent configuration plugin added, a `configure` script block is made
available, within which you can configure the project:

```groovy
configure {
  createGroovyProject()
    .useJavaVersion(17)
    .useMavenCentralAndSnapshots()
    .configureSource()
      .withSourceDirectory('source')
      .withDependencies() {
        implementation 'org.apache.groovy:groovy:4.0.27'
      }
      .expandExtensionModuleVersion('moduleVersion', version)
    .configureTesting()
      .withTestDirectory('test')
      .withTestDependencies() {
        testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-core:2.3-groovy-4.0'
      }
      .useJunitJupiter()
}
```

### createGroovyProject

Starts a fluent chain for configuring a Groovy project.  This will apply the
`groovy` plugin.

### useJavaVersion(int version)

Sets the version of Java to use in the toolchain configuration.

### useMavenCentralAndSnapshots

Adds the Maven Central and Maven Central Snapshots repositories to the project.

### configureSource

Start configuration of source code -related things.

#### withSourceDirectory(Object path)

Set a combined source & resources directory to use.  This is for those who
prefer co-locating source code and assets.

#### withDependencies(Closure closure)

Configure the dependencies for the project.

#### expandExtensionModuleVersion(String propertyName = 'moduleVersion', String value = project.version)

Expands the given property reference in the Groovy extension module manifest
file to the given value.

### configureTesting

Start configuration of test-related things.

#### withTestDirectory(Object path)

Set the directory in which test code and assets will reside.

#### withTestDependencies(Closure closure)

Configure the testing dependencies for the project.

### useJunitJupiter

Configure all test suites to use JUnit Jupiter.
