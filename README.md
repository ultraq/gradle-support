Gradle Support
==============

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions)

A bunch of Gradle plugins that help support my workflow.  These plugins are very
geared towards how I work, so will unlikely be of any use to others.  However,
many of my public projects rely on these, so I've made these available so others
can at least build my projects on their own machines.
