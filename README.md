Gradle Support
==============

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultraq/gradle-support/actions)

Gradle plugins that help support my workflow.  The plugins are very geared
towards how I work, so might not be of much use to anybody else.  Since many of
my public projects rely on them however, I thought it best to distribute the
plugins too so others can build my projects on their own machines.

Versions prior to 5.0.0 were plain Gradle build scripts that I referenced with
raw GitHub URLs to tagged versions.  Gradle has been discouraging that approach
for a *very* long time, so now I'm trying to make these legit plugins ðŸ˜…  If
you're looking for one of those older scripts, use the branch/tag navigation
control to locate them.


Installation
------------

These plugins are built targeting Gradle 9, so require Java 17 as well.

Add the following to the `settings.gradle` file (while these plugins are under
development, I'll just be pushing snapshots to Maven central.  Once they're
stable, I'll try publish them to the Gradle Plugin Portal so then this little
bit won't be needed any more)

```groovy
// settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
	}
}
```

Then, add the plugin to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// build.gradle
plugins {
  id 'nz.net.ultraq.gradle.groovy-development' version '0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
